This programme returns the square root of the (positive) number entered by the user.

In this programme, we implement the Babylonian algorithm (also known as Hero's method) to approximately calculate the square root.

The idea involved is that if X is an underestimate to the square root of S, then S/X must be an overestimate, and vice-versa.
Therefore, the average of X and S/X is a better estimate of the sqaure root of S than X.
Thus, with every iteration, the value of X converges with the actual square root.

For this programme, we have set the tolerance to 0.0000000001%.

The input to the programme starts with the number of test cases (T).
This is followed by each of the T test cases, which must all be positive numbers.
The programme prints the square root of each test case.
