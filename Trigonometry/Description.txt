This programme calculates the values of the fundamental trigonometric ratios – sine and cosine, and uses them to derive the value of the tangent.

In this programme, we implement infinite series approximations to calculate the fundamental rations as the sum of infinite series.
We also calculate the value of π (mathematical constant defined as circumference/diameter for any circle) at the beginning of every execution, in a similar manner.

For this programme, the precision has been set for 3 decimal places.
